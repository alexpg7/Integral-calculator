## üó∫Ô∏èA world without numerical methods

Let's imagine a world where Riemann integral's were never meant to be computed through numerical methods. Could we build a tool that can do it for us? The answer is **yes**.

Usually, integrals are computed through summing the heights of a function multiplying them by a certain width, what is called the [trapezoidal rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule). For high dimensions (multiple integrals) the computation might be difficult, specially when the bounds of the integral are strange or depend on the integration variables.

The ''solution'' to this problem could be training a **Neural Network** (**NN**) to do the job for us. Obviously, for 1 variable functions the job could be counterproductive; this is just an exercise to learn [**TensorFlow**](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=es-419).

The example we will use will be the integration through the $(-3,3)$ interval.

## üìëPreparing the dataset

Firstly, we have to import the libraries that we will use.

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
```

The dataset to train the model will be a list of polynomial functions (of order 4) and they correspondant area. Since they are polynomial, the area can be calculated analytically (that was the whole starting point).

```math
\begin{align}
f(x)=&Ax^4+Bx^3+Cx^2+Dx+E \\
F(x)=&\frac A5x^5 + \frac B4 x^4 + \frac C3 x^3 + \frac D2 x^2 + Ex+K \\
\int_{-3}^3f(x)dx =& F(3)-F(-3)
\end{align}
```

The parameters $A,B,C,D,E,F$ of the function will be randomly generated.
